# WebScraping
What basically is happening in the code is, there are scrapper .py files, this file has json arrays which contain the data of websites.

Then in 'Main.py' file, that array is being converted into string so that the overall data can be compressed.

In 'functions.php' , data is in string form.

In 'dashboard.js' , data is converted in JSON form.
